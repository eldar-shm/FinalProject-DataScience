Luka Dončić (LOO-kuh DON-chitch) has put up historic numbers through first two NBA seasons, producing one of the best starts to a career the league has ever seen. He turned just 21 years old on Feb. 28, 2020, and finished with the second-highest scoring average (24.2 ppg) by a player before his 21st birthday in league history (LeBron James, 25.0 ppg). He also produced 21 of his franchise-record 25 triple-doubles before his 21st birthday, by far the most by a player before turning 21 in league history.
Dončić (6-7, 230) was originally selected by Atlanta with the third overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft, before having his draft rights traded to Dallas in exchange for the draft rights to the fifth overall pick Trae Young and a future first-round selection. He holds career averages of 24.7 points, 8.5 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.1 steals and 32.8 minutes per game in 133 games (all starts) with the Mavericks.
After an outstanding first season that saw him earn Kia Rookie of the Year honors in 2018-19, Dončić garnered All-NBA First Team accolades as a 21-year-old in 2019-20. He became the first player to earn All-NBA First Team honors in either his first or second season since Tim Duncan in 1998-99. He also became the sixth player in league history to be named All-NBA First Team at age 21-or-younger (James, Max Zaslofsky, Kevin Durant, Duncan, Rick Barry). Dončić joined the great Dirk Nowitzki (2004-05, 2005-06, 2006-07, 2008-09) as the only Mavericks to be tabbed All-NBA First Team.
The Slovenian (20 years, 353 days) became the youngest European-born player to start an All-Star Game when suited up for Team LeBron at All-Star 2020 in Chicago. He also took home Western Conference Player of the Month (November 2019) and Player of the Week (Nov. 18 through Nov. 24, 2019) honors in 2019-20.
Dončić finished fourth in voting for the Kia Most Valuable Player Award and third in voting for the Kia NBA Most Improved Player Award in 2019-20. At 21 years, 168 days old on the final day of the 2019-20 regular season, he became the youngest player in NBA history to lead the league outright in triple-doubles (17).
BEFORE NBA
Before being taken with the third pick in the draft, Dončić led Spain’s Real Madrid to the 2018 EuroLeague title while becoming the youngest player ever to earn EuroLeague and EuroLeague Final Four MVP honors. He has also competed for the Slovenian national team and helped the squad to a gold-medal finish at EuroBasket 2017.
